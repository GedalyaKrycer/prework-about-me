      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I work for a design agency as a Senior Web Designer and am currently working on gaining the skill sets to become a developer. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am from Melbourne Austral originally, but have lived all over the United States.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Two of my favorite hobbies include working out and watching (Marvel) movies. They both allow me to decompress, while also being enjoyable to do with my wife and our friends.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job will allow me to "do" things most of the time, instead of managing projects, budgets and people. It would be for a company that I respect, has a professional structure and provides work that I find interesting.</p> 
      <p> would allow me to learn new things, but not in a way where I always feel under qualified. Lastly, it would offer a team of peers and supervisors that I respect and enjoy working with/for.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live is Las Vegas, NV.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I find the tech aspect interesting and there is comfort in the structure of coding. I prefer to problem-solve and see results, then create a big marketing campaign. Earning potential for this career field will also allow my wife to stay home with our future children. Finally, I feel excited at the prospect of being able to not just design a site, but build and launch it as well. It helps me feel more capable and useful.</p>
